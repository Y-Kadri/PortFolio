    "bio": "Hi, I'm Yanis Kadri, and welcome to my portfolio!\n\nI am a Full Stack application design engineer and developer, with a degree in Computer Science and currently studying engineering at CESI. For almost three years, I have been working as a work-study student at SQLI Bordeaux, where I design and develop modern web applications.\n\nWhat made me love computer science? Curiosity. I always wondered how applications, websites, and video games worked. I discovered that they all work essentially thanks to lines of code. Since then, I have been constantly exploring new technologies and I enjoy working on web projects, applications, and video games.\n\nIn my projects, I always strive to produce high-quality code, offer a smooth and intuitive user experience, and ensure maintainability to facilitate future developments.\n\nOutside of IT, I enjoy team sports that emphasize cooperation and tactics, such as volleyball and basketball, as well as individual sports like badminton and table tennis.\n\nI am currently looking for a 3-month internship abroad to continue learning and sharing my skills.\n\nFeel free to browse my projects below, from the most recent to the oldest, and check out my resume (in French or international version) to learn more about my background and experience.",
